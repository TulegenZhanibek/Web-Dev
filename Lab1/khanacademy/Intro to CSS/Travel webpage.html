        <h1>Travel to Japan</h1>
        <h2 class = "city"><em>Almaty</em></h2>

        <p id="culture1">Japan's fiscal year ends in a flurry of activity on March 31, leaving much of the population in the mood to kick back. Hanami parties provide the leisure activity par excellence, as revelers stretch out on tarps to spend time with friends and family. While most cities have a go to spot, you can enjoy the hanami experience in any park or public space where the cherry trees are in bloom.</p>
        <h2 class = "city"> Under the lights</h2>
        <img src = "https://res.cloudinary.com/jnto/image/upload/w_750,h_503,fl_lossy,f_auto/v1516473290/niigata/Niigata1820_3" alt = "beaty2" width = "350">
        <p id="culture2">Takada Castle Site Park  in Niigata  and Hirosaki Park  in Aomori  are great spots for nighttime blossom viewing. Much thought goes into illuminating large numbers of trees with impressive results. Takada Park deserves special mention for its spacious castle grounds and impressive blossom corridor. Plan your trip to Takada in early to mid-April and Hirosaki, later, at the end of the month.</p>
